# lottery-wheel
- A simple lottery wheel game for an interview assignment.
- Written in vanilla JS, while using two additional NPM libraries:
- 1. spin-wheel for the wheel animations
- 2. party-js for the confetti animations
 
- To review the app, you can simply run the html file in your browser (You may have to use VsCode's live server extension to avoid CORS errors.)
